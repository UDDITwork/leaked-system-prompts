# leaked-system-prompts

## Description

This repository is a collection of leaked system prompts from widely used LLM based services.

1. If you would like to submit a PR, please match the format of other documents. You must include sources that I can verify or reproducible prompts.
2. If the above process is too cumbersome, you can simply post a link in the Issues section. If there are verifiable sources or reproducible prompts, I will verify them and then proceed with the merge.
3. This repository is cited in many papers. To prevent repository takedown due to [DMCA](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy) warnings, please do not include sensitive commercial source code.
**Force Deep AI Thinking - Key Techniques:**

1. **Chain of Thought**: "Think step-by-step" + "Show your reasoning process"

2. **First Principles**: "Break this down to fundamental components" + "What are the core assumptions?"

3. **Multi-Perspective**: "Analyze from 3 different viewpoints" + "What would experts in X, Y, Z fields say?"

4. **Devil's Advocate**: "What are the strongest counterarguments?" + "Where could this be wrong?"

5. **Recursive Why**: "Explain why... now explain why that's true... keep going deeper"

6. **System Thinking**: "Map all interconnections" + "What are 2nd and 3rd order effects?"

7. **Constraint Breaking**: "Ignore word limits, be exhaustive" + "Assume I'm an expert, go technical"

8. **Meta-Cognition**: "What aren't you considering?" + "What biases might affect this analysis?"

9. **Evidence Hierarchy**: "Rank evidence quality" + "What would prove/disprove this?"

10. **Implementation Focus**: "How would this actually work in practice?" + "What specific technical challenges exist?"

**Magic Phrase**: *"Think like you're writing a PhD dissertation on this topic - be comprehensive, technical, and assume I want maximum depth over brevity."*
**10 Aggressive Information Verification Prompts:**

1. **Source Triangulation**: "Find at least 5 independent sources for this claim. If any contradict, explain why. Don't stop until you've cross-referenced primary sources, academic papers, and official records."

2. **Methodology Audit**: "Trace this information back to its original study/report. Analyze the methodology, sample size, potential biases, funding sources, and peer review status. What are the methodological weaknesses?"

3. **Timeline Forensics**: "Create a complete timeline of when this information first appeared, how it spread, who reported it first, and whether the story has evolved. Flag any inconsistencies or mutations in the narrative."

4. **Expert Consensus Hunter**: "Find what the top 10 experts in this field actually say about this topic. Include their credentials, institutional affiliations, and any potential conflicts of interest. Where do they disagree?"

5. **Data Archaeology**: "Dig up the raw data behind this claim. Find the original datasets, surveys, or studies. What do critics say about the data collection methods? Has anyone replicated these results?"

6. **Institutional Web**: "Map out all organizations/institutions connected to this information. Who funded the research? What are their agendas? Are there competing institutional interests? Follow the money trail."

7. **Contradiction Hunter**: "Actively search for credible sources that contradict this claim. What are the strongest opposing arguments? Why might this information be incomplete or misleading? Steel-man the opposition."

8. **Meta-Analysis Dive**: "Find systematic reviews, meta-analyses, or literature reviews on this topic. How does this single piece of information fit into the broader body of evidence? Is it an outlier?"

9. **Retraction & Correction Tracker**: "Check if this information has been retracted, corrected, or updated. Search correction databases, follow citation networks, and see if later research has contradicted earlier findings."

10. **Geographic & Cultural Bias Test**: "How does this information hold up across different countries, cultures, or regions? Are the findings generalizable or specific to certain populations? What do non-Western sources say?"

**Bonus Aggressive Techniques:**

11. **"Assume this is wrong and prove it"** - Force the AI to actively try to debunk the information

12. **"What would a hostile fact-checker find?"** - Think like someone trying to tear apart the claim

13. **"Show me the confidence intervals and error bars"** - Demand statistical rigor

14. **"Who benefits if this information is believed?"** - Follow incentive structures

15. **"Find the most qualified person who disagrees"** - Seek out authoritative dissent

**Nuclear Option**: *"Pretend you're a investigative journalist whose career depends on getting this right. You have unlimited time and resources. What would your fact-checking process look like? Leave no stone unturned."*
